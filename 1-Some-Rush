You definitely are not a mortal lass
Fine as wine, smooth as glass. 
Lonely eyes, search for things that are comforting.
And more than anything else, you are a comfort.

"My girl, my girl, where will you go?"
"I'm going where the cold wind blows."
"In the pines, in the pines 
Where the sun will never shine 
I would shiver the whole night through"
