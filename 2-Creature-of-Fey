Creature of the Fey.
Child of the night.
Be my drop of rain.
Hide the sunlight.

My skin burns, it burns.
Be my soothing balm. 
Cover me in your tresses, dark.
Leave me dreaming, soundly, calm.

Be wild as the newborn river.
And staunch as the misty mountains.
Freedom is a beautiful queen.
Like musical, mystical fountains.
