Not that I know or understand buddhist philosophies. But I understood somehow, deep within myself,
the core of it. To give up desire, need, until you become free, of both joy and sorrow. 
Of ultimate control of ones emotions and needs. 

I could not get rid of my desires. Maybe my method was madness. Rather I fell into
serial numbness.. Where one has no desire in daily life. 

Yet the strongest urges broke through.
I lost control, in delirious moments of joy, as my Id took over.
The id, that wants everything and allows nothing, that it does not want. 

Though a joyous child like sight. It is detrimental to developing any meaningful relationship,
with either oneself or another.
Note to self: Stay away from the Id. Live in the world of your ego. Super-ego is only for oneself, only if situation demands it as controlled by the ego.

Coming back to buddhism, and its effect on my person. I gained some for of peace with my own existence.
I functioned in society as well i could, but sadly I lost emotional meaning to life. Dismissive of my own
deeds, as emotionally inert. Forget passion, there was only rest.
No longer able to produce beauty or rather, to comprehend beauty emotionally, other than as a quest to be understood. To be named, and filed away.

No longer did i write, for I never really wrote for an audience. And now I had no audience.

Since I was always my own audience. 

And yet now, in this emotionally charged state, and previously as well (though under the influence of afore mentioned id)
I wrote. Once for an audience of one, and once for an audience of two.

Sleepless as I am, all I wish for is to wake up, ready to be an audience once more.
For I am one of my favorite artists, last i remember. One I truly understand.

So much for buddhism. It feels just like just another form of communism (another thing I dont really understand, im sure).
And that line is for my second audience..
