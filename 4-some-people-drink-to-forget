Some people drink to forget. 
I can't understand that. 

I drink to remember..

The court of wise men. 
The refuge of my kin. 
The clarion call of Norselord.
The green paladin. 

The wrath, the ruin, the red dawn. 
The 12 hour trip, that happy morn. 
When comrades in vision shared satisfied smiles.
When the lord of the rings, fell to the hobbit's wiles.

The 80 rs. to delirium. 
The 800 rs. to temporary death.
The Old monk taking you on a knowledge trip. 
Making Sip and dine, seem like the sunset strip. 

So remember, my friends, remember.. 
The month of December.. 
The endless buzz of pretty faces.
Asleep on the cool grass, free of all races.

So I can never drink in sadness. 
The happiness associated with it is too strong.

Cheers. !
